# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

The goal of the project is to build a document scanner app for Android that:

1. Captures documents using the phone's camera
2. Automatically detects document edges and applies perspective correction
3. Enhances the image to make it look like a proper scanned document (not just a photo)
4. Saves as PDF to the device's internal storage
5. Is ad-free unlike existing apps on the Play Store

## Technology Stack (React Native)

- Framework: React Native
- Document Scanning: react-native-document-scanner-plugin (handles edge detection, perspective correction, image enhancement)
- PDF Generation: react-native-pdf-lib
- File System: react-native-fs (to save PDFs to Documents folder)
- State Management: React Context API or Zustand

## Standard Workflow

1. First, carefully and systematically think through the problem and break it up into phases.

2. Write your plan to TASKS.md and break each phase into a subset of to-do items.

3. Review your plan with me before you start coding.

4. Once approved, start working through the items and cross them off as you complete them.

5. Always add unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests where relevant.

6. After completing a phase, add a high level summary/explanation of the completed work at the end of each phase in the TASKS.md file. Also which tests you added relating to that phase.

7. Make every task and code change as simple as possible. Don't overcomplicate the code, especially not for an MVP.

8. Never use hardcoded API keys in the source code. Use a .env file to store API keys and database connection credentials. Since you do not have access to the .env file, use .env.example to build an example .env file.

9. If you are unsure how to proceed, rather stop and ask than just assuming and doing something I might not like.

## MCP Usage

1. Use the Context7 MCP server for up-to-date documentation on the different technologies being used.

2. Use the Magic UI MCP server for UI inspiration. I would like a minimalist look like Google uses with the class and style associated with Apple. I think the Roboto font from Google could be nice.

3. When you find yourself needing to think more carefully about a problem, use the Sequential Thinking MCP.

4. If you need to search the web, use the Exa or Brave MCP servers---Exa for more detailed technical research and Brave for more general-purpose research.

5. To remeber key aspects of the project, use the Memory MCP to store context.

6. For end-to-end testing, use the Playwrite MCP server.
